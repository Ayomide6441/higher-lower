# Project: Higher or Lower

<!-- SQL injection is a common security vulnerability for web application developers
to defend against. Or - it used to be common, until many web application
frameworks started including built-in guards against it.

In this assignment, you'll use what you've learned to craft a SQL injection
attack against a route in an application.

Then, you'll update the code in the application so that it's safe against SQL
injection. -->

## The Assignment Scores Application

<!--
This example application shows the assignment scores for different students. The
index page shows a list of students with a link to view each of their scores.
The /scores page shows the scores for that student. It also allows the student
to update their name.

_Note: This application is bad in lots of ways (any student can view any other
student's grades, or change their name!) For this assignment, we're focused only
on attacking and defending the SQL injection vulnerability, not fixing the other
issues._ -->
